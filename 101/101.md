If you see "Error: can't find schedule pages", you need to goto Step #3 to make sure you have opened the schedule page.


### #2. How to make sure it's running?

Method A: If you have opened the schedule pages, you can click the start button of this extension. If the pages you opened refresh after you hit the start button, it works well.

Method B: Check if the schedule pages automatically refresh at a random time, if so it works well.
